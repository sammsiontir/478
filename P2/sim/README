usage for binary simulator:

%> ./simulator <blif file> < <input file>

<blif file> is the blif file that you want to simulate.
<input file> stores the values of the primary inputs.

Example: ./simulator adder16.blif < inputs.txt
simulates adder16.blif with its primary input values stored in inputs.txt.

After the blif file is read in, the program displays the order at which
the values of primary inputs should be inputted. This will be in the order
of the primary inputs in the blif file.

Sample:
------------------------------------------------------------
%> ./simulator adder16.blif
reading adder16.blif...
adder16.blif successfully read in.

Inputs (in the order of input):
a[15]...a[0]
b[15]...b[0]
cin
<wait for user input>
------------------------------------------------------------

The input file should have inputs specified, followed by a new line.
A sample input file for adder16.blif would look something like:

---------------------
0101010101010101
0001011101010111
1
---------------------

the first line is a[15]...a[0]
the second line is b[15]...b[0]
the third line is cin
