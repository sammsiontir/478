-------------------------
Project 1: BDDs.

A valid boolean expression consists of
(1) single character vars, and 
(2) AND, OR, NOT and parenthesis

 example: (a & !b | !a & b) & c
-------------------------

Choose a print mode: (v)erbose, (n)on-verbose

Enter a boolean expression:
in bdd form:
a 4
 |__b 3
 |  |__1
 |  |__0
 |__0


probability: 0.25

current state of tables:

computed_table:
{and,   2,   3}  -->  4

unique_table:
{a,   0,   1}  -->  2
{a,   0,   3}  -->  4
{b,   0,   1}  -->  3

Would you like to...

(a)pply an operation with another bdd?									
(n)egative cofactor? 
(p)ositive cofactor? 									
(b)oolean difference? 
(s)ort by influence?                                     
(q)uit

Enter a single character variable: 
result:
a 2
 |__1
 |__0
